# Types

This is for interfaces/types that are highly reusable througout the code base. If the type or interface is specfic for a component, please put that interface closer to the reference

These `types` can be imported in `tsx` files using `@types`

```tsx
import { ClientType, NotificationType } from '@types';
```
