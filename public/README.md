# Public

This folder is for storing media, images, and icons.

This content can be imported in `tsx` files using `@public`

```tsx
import { Arrow, Camera } from '@public';
```

## Sub-folders and files

`/icons` : contains the icons as `SVG` file but encapsulated in a `tsx` file. This give us more flexibilities, for instance, by changing some colors or part of the vector file.
