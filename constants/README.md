## Constants

This folder is for storing variables that are used in various locations within the APP. It may be DB table name, specific watermark name...etc.

These `constants` can be imported in `tsx` files using `@const` (path defined in [`tsconfig.json`](../tsconfig.json))

```js
import { something } from '@const';
```
