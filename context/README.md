# Context

This is for storing contexts (vairables that are used in various places in the application). Please refer to this [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) for deciding whether you should context to store your data.

These `context` can be imported in `tsx` files using `@context`

```js
import { something } from '@context';
```
